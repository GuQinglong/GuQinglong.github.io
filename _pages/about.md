I am a postdoctoral associate at Yale University School of Medicine, working with Prof. John Murray. I was previously a PhD student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University with Prof. David Cai and Douglas Zhou.

I am based in New Haven.

### Research Interest

I investigate cognitive neuronal dynamics through microcircuit models, and try to gain insights into the distributed computational mechanisms of various cognitive processes through large-scale modeling. The close interplay between modeling and experiment is at the heart of my research program. In the past, I have collaborated with experimentalists and analyzed data across a range of levels: neuronal spike train data,
neuroimaging data, and cognitive behavioral data. I used a combination of statistical analysis and mathematical/computational modeling.
