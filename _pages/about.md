My name is Takuya (Taku) Ito, and Iâ€™m a PhD candidate working with [Dr. Michael Cole](http://colelab.org) at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience, Rutgers University.

I received my undergraduate degree in 2013 from Washington University in St. Louis with majors in Mathematics and Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology and a minor in Computer Science.

#### Research Interest

Broadly, my research is in cognitive, network, and computational neuroscience.

I study the role of large-scale brain network organization in distributed information processing. In particular, I am interested in the computational and network mechanisms of how information is transferred and transformed between brain areas, and how these processes relate to flexible behaviors. To address these questions, I use a combination of statistical analysis of neural data sets and mathematical/computational modeling. 

I also have interests in neural network modeling, graph theory, nonlinear dynamics, machine learning, and information theory.
