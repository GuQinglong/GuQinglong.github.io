My name is Takuya (Taku) Ito, and I’m currently a PhD student working with Dr. Michael Cole at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience, Rutgers University.

I received my undergraduate degree in 2013 from Washington University in St. Louis with majors in Mathematics and Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology and a minor in Computer Science.

**Research Interest**

Broadly, my research is in cognitive, network, and computational neuroscience.

I’m interested in multilevel brain network organization, from small neural circuits to large-scale functional networks. In particular, I’m interested in the role these networks play in distributed information processing, with a particular emphasis in flexible/adaptive behaviors. I use a combination of neuroimaging methods and mathematical/computational modeling.

I also have interests in neural network modeling, graph theory, nonlinear dynamics, machine learning, and information theory.
